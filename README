In Chrome:

	- Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the wrench icon and choosing Tools > Extensions.
	- If Developer mode has a + by it, click the + to add developer information to the page. 
	  The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.
	- Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog appears.
	- In the file dialog, navigate to your extension's folder and click OK.

In Firefox:

	- install the add-on SDK
	  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/1.1/dev-guide/addon-development/installation.html
	- build the xpi: (addon-sdk-1.1)~/mozilla/addon-sdk-1.1 > cfx xpi
	- import the xpi in Firefox
	
On Dropbox:

	- copy the browser.html file in your dropbox folder, you can rename it if you like.
	- search for <userid> and replace it with your dropbox id.
	
	the tool is purely experimental, that's the reason why you have to create a dropbox application
